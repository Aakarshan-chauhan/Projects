## Running Files
How do you run your files? What should happen when you run your files?
Run the churn_library.py to obtain all information which includes: <br/>
- EDA
- Model
- Classification report
- logs

### Logging and Testing
churn_script_logging_and_tests.py logs all the successes and failures 
that occur in the important functions of churn_library.py.</br>
A normal run will results in the logs file to look like this
